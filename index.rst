Welcome to the CyVerse Learning Center (*beta*)
-----------------------------------------------

The CyVerse Learning center is a *beta* release of our learning materials in the popular
"Read the Docs" formatting. We are transitioning our leaning materials into this format
to make them easier to search, use, and update. We will be making regular contributions
to these materials and you can suggest new materials or create and
share your own. If you have ideas or suggestions please email `Tutorials@CyVerse.org <mailto:Tutorials@cyverse.org>`_.
You can also view, edit, and submit contributions on `GitHub <https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials>`_.

About CyVerse
-------------

**CyVerse Vision:** Transforming science through data-driven discovery.

**CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national
cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in
its use. CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.


While originally created with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future. CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and community-driven needs
shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide the
infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
educational agenda.
