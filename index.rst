Data Management and Software Reproducibility Workshops
---------------------------------------------------------

Working with “Big data” is challenging for most researchers. These workshops
introduce free  open-source approaches that reduce these challenges and deliver
research that is more impactful, open, and reproducible. Technologies covered
feature solutions developed by publicly funded cyberinfrastructure developed in
the US (CyVerse - www.cyverse.org) and Europe (CyVerse UK, ELIXIR, and others).


Upcoming Workshops

Audience
```````````

Investigators and researchers working in all areas of the life sciences.
Workshop delivery style will benefit those looking for information on and making
decisions about these technologies (e.g. principal investigators, grant writers,
funders/grant officers, etc.) but who may not actually use them day-to-day.
Basic knowledge of command line software (e.g. Linux/Unix) is beneficial
(but not required) for the Software Reproducibility workshop.


Learning Outcomes
```````````````````

At these workshops learners will..

*Data Management Workshop*

- Be able to identify common challenges for large biological datasets
- Understand the value of  FAIR and other open science principles
- Understand how to apply free technologies for data sharing, metadata
  annotation, and repository hosting to their own use cases
- Be able to critique data management plans and create (or refine) a custom plan
  that benefits their lab and their research

*Software Reproducibility Workshop*

- Be able to identify common reproducibility challenges for commonly used
  software
- Follow a series of case studies that introduce reproducibility technologies
  like version control (e.g. git, GitHub) and containerization (Docker)
- Be able to deploy reproducible applications using Binder and CyVerse
- Understand (and be able to create) a software management plan that benefits
  their lab and their research

About CyVerse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**CyVerse Vision:** Transforming science through data-driven discovery.

**CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national
cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in
its use. CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.

While originally created with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future. CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and
community-driven needs shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide
the infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
educational agenda.
